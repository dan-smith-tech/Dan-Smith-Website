## Learning through writing

Learning new skills (and developing my existing ones) and innovating on technology are what motive me in life, and so I love to experiment with new technology, frameworks, and programming languages. This blog will allow me to document the journeys I go on, and the process of writing them out will not only reinforce my understanding, but also ensure that I have fully grasped all of the concepts involved.

## Sharing my experiences

I am now studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bath (I'm currently in the first year of my undergraduate degree), but before this I was never able to formally study Computer Science in school, so I 'taught myself' many different programming languages, frameworks, and web technologies using the amazing resources on the web. I'd now like to contribute to the developer community by sharing the things I learn and have experience with, in the hopes that it will help someone solve a problem, learn something new, or just fix a bug they've been trying to squash for hours...

## How I created the blog

I built this portfolio website using Next.js ([it's open-source on GitHub!](https://github.com/dan-smith-tech/website)), and use `react-markdown` with `gray-matter` to parse markdown files and then render them as HTML. I'm using [Next.js' dynamic routes system](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) to pre-generate a static page for each of the blog posts, which happens when I deploy a production build of the site.

## The future

I hope this is the start of a long adventure, and that there are many more technologies and programming problems to be explored in the future.
