		date: "June 2023 - September 2023",
		summary:
			"Working alongside the head of kernel development at Wolfram, I integrated LLVM technology and expanded the functionality of various parts of the Wolfram compiler. I developed an interface for Intel’s MKL (enhancing CPU-based linear algebra computations), and optimised the MXNet interface by refactoring  C++ to facilitate the creation of more complex neural networks. I also co-created a sparse polynomial data structure, along with various efficient operations, and devised a modular benchmarking system for comparison of the C++ standard library and compiled Wolfram Language, planned for use within future Wolfram presentations.",
